# Introduction to GraogQL + MongoDB: Basic

The basic codes to work with [GraogQL](http://graphql.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) in terminal.<br>
No other dependencies are being used than `graghql`, `mongodb`, or  `mongoose` in the method 2 that is explained below.

This code is for understanding the basic concept of how to work with GraphQL and MongoDB.

## Two ways to use `[GraphQL.js](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/)`

1. `[GraphQLObjectType](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlobjecttype)`

The method 1 is to use `GraphQLObjectType`, which is the original way to create GrapQL API, requires more work than the method 2. This method is good only when you want to understand the concept of GraphQL.

2. `[buildSchema](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/utilities/#buildschema)`

The method 2 is `buildSchema`, which creates a GraphQLSchema object from GraphQL schema language. As you will see, the method 2 is easier than the method 1 and more preferableâ€”if you do not want to use other extra GraphQL packages.
This methods uses Mongoose to establish a connection to database.

## Get started

Seeding:

```bash
# In another terminal window
# Run MongoDB deamon
$ mongod

# Change your working directory
$ cd /PATH/TO/Basic

# Install packages
$ yarn

# Generate initial data
$ yarn seed
# or
$ node seed.js
```

## Scripts

- query: Retrieves data from database.
- query2: Does same as `query`.
- add: Adds new data to database.
- add2: Does same as `add`.
- remove: Remove particular data(one document) that matches arguments from database.
- remove2: Does same as `remove`.

```bash
$ yarn SCRIPT
```
